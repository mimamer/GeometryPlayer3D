eventbinder
-----------

.. py:class:: EventBinder

    The `EventBinder` class binds the buttons to specific commands of their specific
    handlers. For example the forward-button '‚èµ' is bounded to the `forwards`
    method of the provided SequenceManager.

    .. py:function:: EventBinder.__init__(self, plot_3d, sequence_manager)

        Initializes the eventbinder and does trigger the register methods
        with the given arguments. TODO

    .. py:function:: get_button_list_bottom(self)

        Returns the generated button list for the bottom navigation bar
        of the root window. The button list consists of PySimpleGUI.Button
        and PySimpleGUI.ButtonMenu elements.

    .. py:function:: register_view_menu_events(self,plot_3d:Plot3D)

        The button names are bounded to the specific plot_3d 
        `view`-commands by using a list of ButtonEvent elements.
        The `Reset View` button menu is also being composed here.

        :param self: non-static method
        :param plot_3d: plot_3d should be the Plot3D belonging to 
            the root window. 
        :type data: Plot3D
        :type self: EventBinder
        :return: List of ButtonEvents and the `Reset View` button menu
        :rtype: PySimpleGUI.ButtonMenu, list[ButtonEvents]

    .. py:function:: register_playback_speed_events(self)

        The button names are bounded to the dummy function 
        (see :py:func:`trigger_playback_menu_events`).
        Also the `Playback Speed` button menu is also being composed here.

        :param self: non-static method
        :param plot_3d: plot_3d should be the Plot3D belonging to 
            the root window. 
        :type data: Plot3D
        :type self: EventBinder
        :return: List of ButtonEvents and the `Reset View` button menu
        :rtype: PySimpleGUI.ButtonMenu, list[ButtonEvents]

Static Methods
----------------

.. py:staticmethod:: dummy()

    static dummy function. Does nothing, but is useful for 
    special button events that need to be handled by 
    the instance of GeometryPlayer3D directly.
